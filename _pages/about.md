# Biographyï¼š
I received a B.S. degree in Vehicle Engineering from Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2021. I received a M.S. degree in Communications and Transportation from Shandong Jiaotong University, Jinan, China, in 2024. I am currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in Vehicle Engineering at the School of Automobile, Chang'an University, Xiâ€™an, China.

My research  focuses on applying deep learning techniques to predict the lifetime of fuel cell systems. By leveraging large datasets that capture fuel cell operational data under diverse conditions, I aim to develop robust machine learning models that can accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of fuel cells.
